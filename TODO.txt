planned improvements:
- explicit is better than implicit (on bindings level)
  => expose Matrix/Vector types as classes and provide convenience functions to convert back and forth
- find a way to iterate over a list of types to create wrappers - or generate them using xdress

missing functionality:

- Error*List Math/Measurement/Sinks are not wrapped
- ImageMeasurement/Sink are not wrapped

should create a simple OpenGL example to make starting new projects easy

eventually migrate some of the HARP tools into it - including HDF5 recorder

need more tests
