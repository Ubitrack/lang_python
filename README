ubitrack_python - A python wrapper for UbiTrack using boost.python

Author: Ulrich Eck <ueck@net-labs.de>

ubitrack_python provides seamless integration of ubitrack dataflow instances into python based applications for prototyping.
Wrappers are provided for all data- and measurement types, utfacade, utgraph(partly), and utvisualization(draft).

Requirements:
=============

- UbiTrack: (git, master) and all it's requirements
- Python 2.7: (Anaconda for Win32 recommended https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)
- Boost.Python: (needs to be compiled with python, 1.49/1.54 tested)
- boost.numpy: helper for array conversion (git, master, https://github.com/ndarray/Boost.NumPy)

Hint: ubitrack_python's cmake scripts recognize utilize environment variables:

- UBITRACK_PATH: binary installation directory for UbiTrack (bin/, include/, lib/)
- UBITRACK_SOURCE_DIR: source directory of UbiTack for accessing private headers
- UBITRACKLIB_EXTERNAL32/UBITRACKLIB_EXTERNAL64: path to the binary dependency directory
- Boost_DIR/BOOSTROOT: binary installation directory for Boost
- OPENCVROOT: binary installation directory for OpenCV
- BOOST_NUMPY_DIR: binary installation for Boost.numpy


Installation:
=============

1) install all requirements, if necessary compile from source
2) use cmake to configure the build and compile the wrapper::
  mkdir build
  ccmake ../
  make
3) test the installation (does not yet work on win32)::
  make test
4) install the wrapper::
  make install
